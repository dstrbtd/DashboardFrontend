# Overview
This repository contains the frontend and WebSocket server setup for visualizing live dashboard data from InfluxDB.  
It supports local development, secure deployment via Vercel, and HTTPS WebSocket tunneling with ngrok.

---

# Minimum Requirements
- Node.js and npm installed
- Python 3.10+
- `tmux` for running background processes
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account for secure WebSocket tunneling
- Vercel account for deployment

---

# Installation & Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dstrbtd/DashboardFrontend.git
cd DashboardFrontend
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install websockets pandas influxdb-client
```

2. **Install Node dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```


4. **Run the WebSocket server**
```bash
tmux new -s ws_server
python graph_data/influx/websocket_server.py
# Press Ctrl+b, then d to detach
```

4. **Test the webpage locally**
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173/
```

> Tip:
> To see live data locally, temporarily set CURRENT_WS_URL in
> websocketUrls.js to LOCAL. Don’t forget to switch it back to NGROK before publishing.

# Publishing the Webpage
**Deploy with Vercel**
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Import the DashboardFrontend repository
4. Vercel will auto-deploy after each push.
5. Add a custom domain: dash.dstrbtd.ai and configure your DNS provider with a CNAME record pointing to Vercel.


**Set Up HTTPS WebSocket Tunneling**
Vercel only accepts data via HTTPS.
On the same machine running the WebSocket server:

```bash
tmux new -s ngrok_ws
ngrok http 8765
```

Copy the new ngrok URL and update websocketUrls.js:

```javascript
NGROK: 'wss://<your_ngrok_subdomain>.ngrok-free.app'
```


# Verification
After deployment and ngrok setup:
- Visit https://dash.dstrbtd.ai
- Confirm that live data is flowing from the WebSocket server
